# HTML learnings

During y reading I have discovered a lot of new information. For instance I have never heard about those :

## Chapter 8 - Extra Markup

> DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.
> You can add comments to your code between the
<!-- and --> markers.
> <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed
> Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.

## Chapter 17 - HTML5 Layout
> The <article> element acts as
a container for any section of a
page that could stand alone and
potentially be syndicated.
> The <aside> element has two
purposes, depending on whether
it is inside an <article>
element or not.
> The <section> element groups
related content together, and
typically each section would
have its own heading.

## Chapter 18 - Process & Design

> In order to create a graet web site we need to start with site map
> A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.
> Design has to be concise and use no more that 8 active links
