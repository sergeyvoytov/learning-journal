The short answer is- itâ€™s all magic! Whole bunch of zeros and ones are making everything in the digital world. I enjoy the idea that those videos have explained to the public complicated concepts in simple terms. I believe that is usually the sign of the person who knows what he/she is doing is to explain terms and concepts that 5 year old could understand. 

Those concepts are not new to me, however, it was nice to take a look at those explanations and recall those times when I first discovered the power of computing and engineering.
