# What I have learned so far
I learned that markdown could help me out to keep notes for the class. I believe that that is really fascinating that I could create page with notes blog like in the 
matter of a few minutes.
My favorite features of the markdown are the abilities to put emphasis on the trext and to inset pictures into it.   


I really like the quote of Austin Freeman
