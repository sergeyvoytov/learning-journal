# What I have learned so far
I learned that markdown could help me out to keep notes for the class. I believe that that is really fascinating that I could create page with notes blog like in the 
matter of a few minutes.
My favorite features of the markdown are the abilities to put emphasis on the trext and to inset pictures into it.   


I really like the quote of Austin Freeman
> “Simplicity is the soul of efficiency.”

I could assume that creating different kind of lists could be really beneficial to create documentation as well. There are different kinds of lists such as ordered and unordered list. There are a lot of other opportunities to make your github page better.
