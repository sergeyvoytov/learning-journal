# JS notes
Everything in JavaScript happens in functions.
A function is a block of code, self contained, that can be defined once and run any times you want.
A function can optionally accept parameters, and returns one value.
Functions in JavaScript are objects, a special kind of objects: function objects. Their superpower lies in the fact that they can be invoked.
In addition, functions are said to be first class functions because they can be assigned to a value, and they can be passed as arguments and used as a return value.

Functions can be assigned to variables (this is called a function expression):

`const dosomething = function(foo) {  // do something }`
Parameters
A function can have one or more parameters.
